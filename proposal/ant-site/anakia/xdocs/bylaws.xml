  <p>
    This document defines the bylaws under which the Apache Ant project operates.
    It defines the the roles and responsibilities of the project, who may vote,
    how conflicts are resolved, etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ant is typical of Apache projects in that it operates under a set of principles,
    known as the Apache Way. If you are new to Apache, please refer to the
    <a href="http://incubator.apache.org">Incubator project</a> for more information on
    how Apache projects operate.

  <section name="Roles and Responsibilities">
    <subsection name="Project Management Committee">
      <p>
        The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Ant was created by a resolution of the
        board of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF)on 18th November 2002. The PMC is responsible
        to the board and the ASF for the management and oversight of the Apache Ant codebase.
        The responsibilites of the PMC include
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Deciding what is distributed as products of the Apache Ant project. In particular
            all releases must be approved by the PMC
        </li>
        <li>Maintaining the project's shared resources, including the codebase repository,
            mailing lists, websites.
        </li>
        <li>Speaking on behalf of the project.
        </li>
        <li>Resolving license disputes regarding products of the project
        </li>
        <li>Nominating new PMC members and committers
        </li>
        <li>Maintaining these bylaws and other guidelines of the project
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Membership of the PMC is by invitation only and must be approved by a consensus of active PMC members.
        A PMC member is considered inactive by their own declaration or by not contributing in any form to the
        project for over six months. An inactive member can become active again by reversing whichever condition
        made them inactive (i.e., by reversing their earlier declaration or by once again contributing toward the
        project's work). Membership can be revoked by an unanimous vote of all the active PMC members other
        than the member in question.
      </p>

      <p>
        The chair of the PMC is appointed by the ASF board. The chair is an office holder of the Apache
        Software Foundation (Vice President, Apache Ant) and has primary responsibility to the board for the
        management of the projects within the scope of the Ant PMC. The chair reports to the board quarterly
        on developments within the Ant project. The PMC may consider the position of PMC chair annually
        and if supported by 3/4 Majority may recommend a new chair to the board. Ultimately, however, it is
        the board's responsibility who to appoint as the PMC chair.
      </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name="Committers">
      <p>
        The project's Committers are responsible for the project's technical management. All committers have
        write access to the project's source repository. Committers may cast binding votes on any technical
        discussion regarding the project.
      </p>

      <p>
        Membership as a Committer is by invitation only and must be approved by consensus of the active
        PMC members. A Committer is considered inactive by their own declaration or by not contributing
        in any form to the project for over six months. An inactive committer can become active again
        by reversing whichever condition made them inactive (i.e., by reversing their earlier declaration
        or by once again contributing toward the project's work). Commit access can be revoked by a
        unanimous vote of all the active PMC members (except the member in question if they are a PMC member).
      </p>

      <p>
        All Apache committers are required to have a signed Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file
        with the Apache Software Foundation.
      </p>

      <p>
        A committer who makes a sustained contibution to the project will usually be invited to become a member of
        the PMC.
      </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name="Developers">
      <p>
        All of the volunteers who are contributing time, code, documentation, or resources to the
        Ant Project. A developer that makes sustained, welcome contributions to the project for
        over six months is usually invited to become a Committer, though the exact timing of
        such invitations depends on many factors.
      </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name="Users">
      <p>
        The most important participants in the project are people who use our software. The majority of our
        developers start out as users and guide their development efforts from the user's perspective.
      </p>

      <p>
        Users contribute to the Apache projects by providing feedback to developers in the the form of
        bug reports and feature suggestions. As well, users participate in the Apache community by
        helping other users on mailing lists and user support forums.
