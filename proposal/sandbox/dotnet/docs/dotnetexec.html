    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Executes a .NET assembly that's on your PATH or pointed to
    directly by the executable attribute.</p>

    <p>This task is an extension of Ant's <a
    href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/CoreTasks/exec.html">exec</a>
    task and supports all attributes and nested child elements of that
    task.  Use the executable attribute to specify the name of the
    assembly (including the extension).</p>

    <p>This task allows you to choose the .NET framework via the
    <code>vm</code> attribute.  The default value is "microsoft" on
    Windows and "mono" on all other platforms.  "microsoft" is a magic
    name that means "run the assembly as executable directly" - this
    may also work for Mono on Linux systems with the binfmt feature
    described in the <a
    href="http://www.go-mono.org/faq.html#q86">Mono FAQ</a>.</p>
