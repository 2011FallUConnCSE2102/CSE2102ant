/** 
 * Abstract component creation and configuration. Multiple ComponentHelpers
 * can be registered in a project, either by an embedding application
 * or by taskdef-like tasks.
 *
 * After a ProjectComponentHelper is registered, it'll manage the construction and 
 * configuration of tasks/types/etc. It has full control over how the
 * component is created - and may provide runtime wrapping for components
 * not implementing the Task/DataType interfaces.
 * It works in close relation with TaskAdapter and RuntimeConfigurable
 * to handle delayed evaluation of tasks or custom attribute->task mapping.
 * If it returns a wrapper for Task, the wrapper is required to extend
 * TaskAdapter.
 *
 * The common 'Chain' pattern is used to construct
 * tasks, with the original behavior ( Class registry ) tried last, by the
 * default helper implementation.
