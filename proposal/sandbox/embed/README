Features

- SAX2 support
- namespaces ( not used - pending decision on semantics of ns )
- import ( with package.target, not super.target )
- classloader hack for optional 
- dynamic properties ( only interface + hooks, no real binding )


Todo

- start the JMX support, MBeans for Project, Target and Tasks ( using the dynamic
mbean tool in tomcat ). 

- add JmxTaskAdapter that will wrap mbeans ( similar with the Beans wrapped by task adapter )

- add support for Jmx attributes as dynamic properties.


Build

The build.xml file will copy the files in the main tree and compile 
a package - ant-sax2.jar. 

Install

Copy ant-sax2.jar to jakarta-ant-1.5/lib.
