The input proposal has been accepted as part of main Ant and has been
merged with the main code tree on 2002-04-22.

The only part that didn't get moved over was SwingInputHandler that
has never been more than a proof of concept - if you really want to
see it, you can find it in CVS's Attic:

<http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/jakarta-ant/proposal/sandbox/input/src/main/org/apache/tools/ant/input/Attic/SwingInputHandler.java>
