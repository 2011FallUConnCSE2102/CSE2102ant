                        <p>Ant is a cross-platform build tool that features ease of
            use and extensibility as it's primary goal.</p>
                                <p>Why another build tool when there is already make, gnumake,
            nmake, jam, and others? Make-like tools are inherently shell-based;
            they execute native commands and shell scripts to perform the work
            associated with the build process. So to extend the the tool by
            writing a program or script executable by the OS you are on. This
            makes it difficult to achieve portability between platforms.</p>
                                <p>Ant is a different beast. Instead of using OS-specific commands
            to extend the build process, you leverage the cross-platform features
            of Java to write "tasks". This makes it much easier to achieve
            a portal build process between platforms. Ant also differs in that it uses
            XML to describe the build process.</p>

                                <p>Myrmidon was specifically designed as both a tool and as
            an API library that can be reused in other products. It contains the
            basic building blocks for assembling any sort of task-based tool. Ant 2
            is an example of such a tool, which could be assembled using the Myrmidon
            task container, and a library of build related tasks.

              The name Myrmidon is a derivation of a mythological name for some ants that were turned
              into soldiers by the god Zeus. It came to mean "a subordinate who executes orders
              unquestioningly" which seemed suitable for a task execution/build tool. A more complete
              description stolen from

                <i>The appellation Myrmidon was derived from the Greek word "myrmex",
                meaning ant.  According to Greek mythology, the Myrmidons were
                transformed into humans by the god Zeus as an act of kindness to his
                son Aeacus.  King Aeacus, captivated by a colony of ants, prayed
                that he should receive an increase in population equal to the
                number of ants before him.  When he awoke the next day, the ants
                were his human subjects.  Thereafter, they were known as the
                Myrmidons.  See "The Iliad" for Homers' account of the Myrmidons
                during the Trojan War.</i>
