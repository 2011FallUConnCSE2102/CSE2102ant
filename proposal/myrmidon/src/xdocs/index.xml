        <section name="What is Myrmidon?">

            <p>
            Myrmidon is one of the Ant 2 proposals currently in development.  You can
            read more about the goals of Ant 2

                <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/ant2/">here</a>.

            </p>

            <p>
            Myrmidon is a general-purpose
                <i>task engine</i>.  It contains the basic
            building blocks for assembling any sort of task-based tool.  Ant 2
            is an example of such a tool, which could be assembled using the Myrmidon task
            engine, and a library of build related tasks.

            </p>

            <p>
            Currently, Myrmidon is a prototype of what a task engine might look.  It
            includes a small set of tasks and data types.  We are currently porting
            many of the Ant 1.x tasks to the Myrmidon task engine.
