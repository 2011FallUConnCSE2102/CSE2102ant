<p>There are plenty of things you can do to help out with Myrmidon.  The Todo
list below describes items which still need to be done.  Of course, since
this is an open-source project, there's plenty of scope for experimentation,
and you can pretty much make up your own items to work on.</p>

<p>Some things that are worth reading if you do want to get involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/ant2/">Ant 2</a> goals and requirements.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/ant2/actionlist.html">Ant 1.9 Action List</a>.</li>
<li>The Jakarta Project's <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/getinvolved.html">Get Involved</a> page.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no Ant 2 or Myrmidon mailing list yet, so direct any questions
or comments you have to the ant-dev mailing list.</p>
