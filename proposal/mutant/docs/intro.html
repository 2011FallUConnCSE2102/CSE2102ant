These pages describe the design and implementation of mutant.
</p>
                                <p>
For some time, there has been the concept of Ant 2.0. a rearchitecting of
Ant designed to address the shortcomings in the design of Ant 1.x while
drawing the experience gained in that development. This rearchitecting
would most likely be accompanied by at least some break in backward
compatability. Indeed this fact was recognized by Duncan, the original
author of Ant when he proposed his AntEater revolution. Over time Ant 2.0
has come to be known as Ant2 and the current Ant codebase is generally
known as Ant1.
</p>
                                <p>
Mutant is my proposal, a revolution, for Ant2. Actually, I consider it more
an evolution of the design and implementation used for Ant1, but in Jakarta
parlance, being a separate codebase, it is termed a revolution.
</p>
                                <p>
There is no special significance in the name mutant. I chose it because, as
a word, it is an extension of the word ant and it also signifies a change
from the previos generation

                        <p>
Mutant is not the only proposed revolution for Ant2. Peter Donald, another
Ant committer, has developed another proposal known as Myrmidon, which you
should also investigate if you are interested in a different view of how
Ant2 should be realized. Other people hold the view that there is no need
for any rearchitecting and the Ant1 codebase can continue to evolve.
</p>
                                <p>
As I write this, no decision has been taken as to which codebase will be
adopted for Ant2. It may not be mutant or it could be some entirely new
proposal. This document does not compare and contrast mutant with these
other proposals or points of view, at least not explicitly. It is just
intended to describe and highlight how mutant is designed and implemented.
