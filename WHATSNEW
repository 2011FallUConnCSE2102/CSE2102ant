Changes from Ant 1.1 to the current sources

Changes that could break older buildfiles:
------------------------------------------

* copying of support files in <javac> has been removed.

* the command line switches _not_ starting with - have been removed.

Other changes:
--------------

* New tasks: sql, junit, javacc, execon. All pending documentation,
most of them pending review.

* <java> uses ClassLoader of its own in no-fork mode if a classpath is
specified.

* <style> will create the necessary target directories and reprocess
all files if the stylesheet changes.

* Path and EnumeratedAttribute moved to a new package
org.apache.tools.ant.types.

* New data types fileset and patternset - expected to get a broader
use, pending documentation.

* You can specify environment variables to the exec task - pending
documentation.

* Get can check wether a remote file is actually newer than a local
copy before it starts a download (HTTP only).

Fixed bugs:
-----------

* <chmod> didn't work when used as a directory based task.

* Path didn't resolve relative filenames with respect to the Project's
basedir.

* Project didn't interpret the basedir attribute correctly in all
cases.
