    <faq id="no-gnu-tar">
      <question>I get checksum errors when I try to extract the
      <code>tar.gz</code> distribution file. Why?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>Ant&apos;s distibution contains file names that are longer
        than 100 characters, which is not supported by the standard
        tar file format. Several different implementations of tar use
        different and incompatible ways to work around this
        restriction.</p>

        <p>Ant&apos;s &lt;tar&gt; task can create tar archives that use
        the GNU tar extension, and this has been used when putting
        together the distribution. If you are using a different
        version of tar (for example, the one shipping with Solaris),
        you cannot use it to extract the archive.</p>

        <p>The solution is to either install GNU tar, which can be
        found <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/tar.html">here</a> 
        or use the zip archive instead (you can extract it using
        <code>jar xf</code>).</p>

    <faq id="xml-entity-include">
      <question>How do I include an XML snippet in my build file?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>You can use XML&apos;s way of including external files and let
        the parser do the job for Ant:</p>

        <source><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0"?>

<!DOCTYPE project [
    <!ENTITY common SYSTEM "file:./common.xml">
]>

<project name="test" default="test" basedir=".">

  <target name="setup">
    ...
  </target>

  &common;

  ...

</project>
]]></source>

        <p>will literally include the contents of <code>common.xml</code> where
        you&apos;ve placed the <code>&amp;common;</code> entity.</p>

        <p>In combination with a DTD, this would look like this:</p>

        <source><![CDATA[
<!DOCTYPE project PUBLIC "-//ANT//DTD project//EN" "file:./ant.dtd" [
   <!ENTITY include SYSTEM "file:./header.xml">
]>
]]></source>
