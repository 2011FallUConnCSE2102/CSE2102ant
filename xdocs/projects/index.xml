    <h3>This is where the Ant sub-projects live!</h3>

    <p>Now, that Ant has become an Apache Top-Level Project it is time to make space on this
    Web-Page for Ant sub-projects. In the first step <a href="antidote/index.html">Antidote</a>,
    the Ant GUI, is included, but some others may follow!
    </p>
    <p>To make sure you do not miss anything: Stay tuned and visit this page from time to time :)!
