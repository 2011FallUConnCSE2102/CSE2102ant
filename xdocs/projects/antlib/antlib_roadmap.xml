  <section name="Antlib with tasks and types only">
  <p>
Let me quote here Stefan Bodewig - April 24th 2003.
</p>
<p>
Let's make a version of antlib that knows about two predefined roles,
task and data-type.  I think this is already feature complete in the
proposal (which does even more).
</p>
<p>
Let's move this code with the restriction to tasks and types into the
main branch ASAP.  Let's sort out the classloading requirements as
well as the interplay of antlib with taskdef and typedef here.
</p>
<p>
After this flies, I'd expect us to get roles sorted out.  If we feel
like removing the difference between tasks and types, we can do so
then as well.
</p>
  </section>
  <section name="Roles and components in build files">
  <p>
A second step : make a detailed proposal concerning roles and  implement roles and components in ant core. 
</p>
  </section>
  <section name="Roles and components in antlibs">
  <p>
  Once roles and components are properly defined and implemented in ant core, we would revisit &lt;antlib&gt; and implement roles and components there.
  </p>
  </section>
  <section name="Namespaces">
  <p>
  After we have antlibs, roles, and components, we should specify how we are going to proceed concerning namespaces and prefixes.
