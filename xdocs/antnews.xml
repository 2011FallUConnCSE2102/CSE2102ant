    <p> Ant 1.7 introduces a resource framework. Some of the core ant 
    tasks such as &lt;copy/&gt; are now able to process not only file 
    system resources but also zip entries, tar entries, paths, ... 
    Resource collections group resources, and can be further 
    combined with operators such as union and intersection. This 
    can be extended by custom resources and custom tasks using resources.</p>

    <p>
    Ant 1.7 starts outsourcing of optional tasks to Antlibs. 
    The .NET antlib in preparation will replace the .NET optional tasks which ship in Ant.
    Support for the version control system Subversion will be only provided as an antlib to
    be released shortly.

  <section name="Antidote Retired">
    <h3>April 4th, 2005 - The Apache Ant Project Retires Antidote, the
    Ant GUI</h3>

    <p>The Antidote subproject was once started to provide a GUI for
    Ant at a time where IDE support for Ant was far from usable.
    Unfortunately it never attracted a developer community of its
    own.</p>

    <p>At the same time IDE support for Ant has become ubiquitous by
    now and there is little reason to have a GUI just for Ant.  This
    makes it even less likely that volunteers will start to spend time
    working on it.</p>

    <p>Antidote's development has been stalled for years now, despite
    some efforts to rejuvenate it by single developers.  Therefore the
    Ant developers have chosen to retire Antidote.</p>

    <p>Antidote will no longer be developed by the Ant project; its
    CVS module will be shut down.</p>

    <p>If you are interested in Antidote's sources to learn from or
    build on it, you can find snapshots at <a
    href="http://archive.apache.org/ant/antidote/">http://archive.apache.org/ant/antidote/</a>.</p>

    <p>Nested elements for namespaced tasks and types may belong to the
Ant default namespace as well as the task's or type's namespace.</p>
    <p>All exceptions thrown by tasks are now wrapped in a
buildexception giving the location in the buildfile of the task.</p>
    <p>Ant 1.6.2 fixes a large number of bugs and adds a number of
features which were asked for by users on Bugzilla.</p>

     <p>As
    we've already said in the announcements of Ant 1.5.4, this release
    requires JDK 1.2 or later to run.</p>

    <p>Ant 1.6.0 adds a lot of new features, most prominently support

    notes.</p>
