    <h3>February 12, 2004 - Ant 1.6.1 Available</h3>
     <p>Apache Ant 1.6.1 is still available for
      <a href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/ant/">download</a>.

    <h3>December 18, 2003 - Ant 1.6.0 Available</h3>
     <p>Apache Ant 1.6.0 is still available for
      <a href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/ant/">download</a>.
     </p>
     <p>As
    we've already said in the announcements of Ant 1.5.4, this release
    requires JDK 1.2 or later to run.</p>

    <p>Ant 1.6.0 adds a lot of new features, most prominently support
    for XML namespaces as well as a new concept of Ant libraries that
    makes use of namespaces to avoid name clashes of custom tasks.
    For a longer list of fixed bugs and new features see the release
    notes.</p>
    
    <p>If you find anything that hasn't been covered in the manual (I bet you
did) or could be explained better, feel free to help us out in the

    <p>This is a minor bugfix release that fixes a problem with the
    <code>javah</code> task on JDK 1.4.2 and a couple of bugs in the
    Visual Age for Java intergration tasks.  If you don't use javah or
    VAJ, there is no reason to upgrade.</p>

  <section name="Ant Top Level Project">
    <h3>November 18, 2002</h3>
    <p>The Apache board <a href="mission.html">created</a>
       the Apache Ant top level project. Ant has now migrated from the Jakarta
       project into an Apache project of its own. This is primarily an
       organizational change and will not affect the technical aspects of
       the project. Ant retains a strong association with the Apache
       Jakarta project. One effect of this change is that the Ant webpage
       is now located at <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">http://ant.apache.org/</a>
