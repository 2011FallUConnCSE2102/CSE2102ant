    <section name="Access the Source Tree (Subversion)">

      <p>Anyone can checkout source code from our public Subversion repository. To do so,
         simply use the following command (if you are using a GUI client, configure it
         appropriately):</p>

      <source>
svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/[project]/trunk/ ant-[project]</source>

      <p>Modules available for access are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>ant - The &quot;main&quot; Ant module.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you are not familiar with Subversion, <a
      href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/cvsindex.html">Jakarta's
      source repositories page</a> may hold many helpful hints.</p>

      <p>Nightly snapshots of the CVS tree are available at 
        <a href="http://cvs.apache.org/snapshots/ant/">http://cvs.apache.org/snapshots/ant/</a>.</p>
