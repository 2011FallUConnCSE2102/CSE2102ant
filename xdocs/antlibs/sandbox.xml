    <section name="Ant Libraries - The Sandbox">

      <p>The sandbox is the place where new Ant Libraries start their
      life, it is a playground for Ant committers and other
      contributors who find committers to sponsor their ideas.</p>

      <p>The sandbox is no dumping ground.  If a Sandbox Ant Library
      fails to attract interest within a reasonable amount of time, it
      gets removed from the sandbox.</p>

      <subsection name="AntUnit - Unit Test Framework for Ant Tasks">

        <p>AntUnit borrows ideas from JUnit 3.x and the &lt;junit&gt;
        task.  It provides a task that runs build files as unit tests
        as well as a number of assertion tasks to support the
        idea.</p>
