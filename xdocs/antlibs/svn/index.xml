    <section name="Idea">
      <p>The main purpose of this Ant library is to provide the same
      level of support that Ant provides for CVS.  This means the
      tasks are wrappers on top of the command line client (read: you
      still need to install an svn client) and there is not much more
      than running the executable and creating some reports.</p>

      <p>If you are looking for projects that aim at more, there are
      better alternatives, for example <a
      href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/svnant.html">Subclipse's Ant
      task</a> or <a
      href="http://tmate.org/svn/ant.html">JavaSVN</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section name="Tasks">
      <subsection name="svn">
        <p>A very thin layer on top of the command line executable,
        comparable to <a
        href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/cvs.html">the CVS
        task</a>.</p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="changelog">
        <p>Creates a log of change comments between two revisions,
        comparable to <a
        href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/changelog.html">CvsChangeLog</a>.</p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="*diff">
        <p><code>&lt;tagdiff&gt;</code> creates a differences report
        for the changes between two tags or branches.</p>

        <p><code>&lt;revisiondiff&gt;</code> creates a differences report
        for the changes between two revisions.</p>

        <p>Together comparable to <a
        href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/cvstagdiff.html">CvsTagDiff</a>.</p>
