      <h3>August 30, 2010 - Apache Compress Ant Library 1.0
      Available</h3>

      <p>Apache Compress Ant Library 1.0 is now available for
      download as <a
      href="http://ant.apache.org/antlibs/bindownload.cgi">binary</a>
      or <a
      href="http://ant.apache.org/antlibs/srcdownload.cgi">source</a>
      release.</p>

    <section name="Compress Antlib">
      <p>This Antlib contains tasks and resources that provide
        compression/uncompression and archival/unarchival capabilities
        based on <a href="http://commons.apache.org/compress/">Apache
        Commons Compress</a>.  Using Apache Commons Compress 1.1 this
        Antlib supports gzip and bzip2 compression and ar, cpio, tar
        and zip archives.</p>

      <p>The current code base is based on the 1.1 release of Commons
        Compress but it is expected that this Antlib follows Commons
        Compress' development and will add new compression or
        archiving formats as they are provided by the underlying
        library.</p>

      <p>The gzip and bzip2 tasks and resources are similar to the
        corresponding tasks and types in Ant's core and mainly just
        use a different code base for the implementation of the
        formats.</p>

      <p>The same is mostly true for the zip and tar resources as well
        as the unzip/tar task with the major difference being that
        unzip and zipfileset can work with non-File resources.</p>

      <p>The zip and tar tasks are completely new implementations and
        offer a superset of the functionality of the core tasks.</p>

      <p>Tasks and resources for the ar and cpio formats mirror those
        available for tar and zip.</p>

      <p>All tasks and types can be mixed with the core tasks and
        types; it is possible to use the core zip task to create an
        archive based on an cpiofileset for example.</p>
