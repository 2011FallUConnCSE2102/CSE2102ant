    <section name="The Ant Libraries Subproject">
      <h3>Ant Libraries - or Antlibs for short</h3>

      <p>With Ant 1.6.0 and the ant libraries concept creating
      libraries of Ant tasks that are easy to get dropped into an
      existing Ant installation has become far easier.</p>

      <p>The Ant Libraries subproject was started as a place to
      develop small libraries of tasks that can get released
      independent of Ant's release schedule - which is necessary for
      nascent Ant tasks since Ant's own release schedule has become
      rather slow over time.</p>

      <p>The subproject also offers a sandbox as playground for Ant
      committers to try new ideas for tasks.</p>
