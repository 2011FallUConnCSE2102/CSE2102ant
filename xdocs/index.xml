    <p>Apache Ant 1.6.1beta1 is now available for <a
      href="http://cvs.apache.org/dist/ant/v1.6.1beta1/">download</a>.</p>

    <p>The Ant 1.6.1 final release will probably be delivered with the
    Apache License 2.0, pending the result of a vote.</p>
    <p>Ant 1.6.1beta1 fixes several bugs, most notably the handling
    of the default namespace for nested elements.</p>
    <p>Ant 1.6.1beta1 also introduces initial support for compiling with
    Java 1.5.</p>

 <section name="Ant 1.6.0">
    <p>Apache Ant 1.6.0 is available since December 18, 2003 for <a
    href="http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi">download</a>.  As
    we've already said in the announcements of Ant 1.5.4, this release
    requires JDK 1.2 or later to run.</p>

    <p>Ant 1.6.0 adds a lot of new features, most prominently support
    for XML namespaces as well as a new concept of Ant libraries that
    makes use of namespaces to avoid name clashes of custom tasks.
    For a longer list of fixed bugs and new features see the release
    notes.</p>
    
    <p>If you find anything that hasn't been covered in the manual (I bet you
did) or could be explained better, feel free to help us out in the
<a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/wiki/apachewiki.cgi?NewAntFeaturesInDetail">Wiki </a>.</p>

  <section name="Apache Ant">

<p>
Apache Ant is a Java-based build tool. In theory, it is kind of like
Make, but without Make's wrinkles.
</p>

<p>
Why another build tool when there is already <em>make</em>, <em>gnumake</em>,
<em>nmake</em>, <em>jam</em>, and
others? Because all those tools have limitations that Ant's original author
couldn't live with when developing software across multiple platforms. Make-like
tools are inherently shell-based -- they evaluate a set of dependencies, then
execute commands not unlike what you would issue in a shell. This means that you
can easily extend these tools by using or writing any program for the OS that
you are working on. However, this also means that you limit yourself to the OS,
or at least the OS type such as Unix, that you are working on.
</p>

<p>
Makefiles are inherently evil as well. Anybody who has worked on them for any
time has run into the dreaded tab problem. &quot;Is my command not executing
because I have a space in front of my tab!!!&quot; said the original author of
Ant way too many times. Tools like Jam took care of this to a great degree, but
still have yet another format to use and remember.
</p>

<p>
Ant is different. Instead of a model where it is extended with shell-based
commands, Ant is extended using Java classes. Instead of writing shell commands,
the configuration files are XML-based, calling out a target tree where various
tasks get executed. Each task is run by an object that implements a particular
Task interface.
</p>

<p>
Granted, this removes some of the expressive power that is inherent by being
able to construct a shell command such as
<code>`find . -name foo -exec rm {}`</code>, but it
gives you the ability to be cross platform -- to work anywhere and everywhere.
And hey, if you really need to execute a shell command, Ant has an
<code>&lt;exec&gt;</code> task that
allows different commands to be executed based on the OS that it is executing
on.
