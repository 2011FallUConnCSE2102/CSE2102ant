		<h3>February 8, 2010 - Ant 1.8.0 Available</h3>
		<p>
			Apache Ant 1.8.0 is now available for
			<a href="http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi">download</a>
			.
		</p>
		<ul>
		    <li>Lexically scoped local properties, i.e. properties that are only
		        defined inside a target, 
                sequential block or similar environment.</li>
            <li>&lt;import&gt; can now import from any file- or URL-providing resource - 
                this includes &lt;javaresource&gt;.</li>    
			<li>Various improvements to the directory scanning code that help 
			with symbolic link cycles (as can be found on MacOS X Java
			installations for example) and improve scanning performance. 
			For big directory trees the improvement is 
            <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/ant-dev/200809.mbox/%3Cy1u4p48li29.fsf@v30161.1blu.de%3E">dramatic</a>.</li>
            <li>The way developers can extend Ant's property expansion algorithm has been rewritten 
            (breaking the older API) to be easier to use and be more powerful.
            </li>
            <li>a new top level element extension-point allows build files to be
				extended with custom targets more easily</li>
			<li>At the same time the if and unless attributes have been rewritten to do the expected 
            thing if applied to a property expansion (i.e. if="${foo}" will mean "yes, do it" 
            if ${foo} expands to true, in Ant 1.7.1 it would mean "no" unless a property named 
           "true" existed). This adds "testing conditions" as a new use-case to property 
            expansion.</li>
			<li>Ant now requires Java 1.4 or later</li>
			<li>new task include provides an alternative to &lt;import> that
				should be preferred when you don't want to override any targets</li>
			<li>numerous bug fixes and improvements as documented in Bugzilla
				and in WHATSNEW</li>

  <section name="Apache Ant">

    <p>
		Ant is a Java library and command-line tool.
		Ant's mission is to drive processes described in build files as targets
		and extension points dependent upon each other.
		The main known usage of Ant is the build of Java applications.
		Ant supplies a number of built-in tasks allowing to compile, assemble,
		test and run Java applications.
		Ant can also be used effectively to build non Java applications, for
		instance C or C++ applications. More generally, Ant can be used to
		pilot any type of process which can be described in terms of targets
		and tasks.
    </p>
	<p>
		Ant is written in Java. Users of Ant can develop their own
		&quot;antlibs&quot; containing Ant tasks and types, and are offered 
		a large number of ready-made commercial or open-source &quot;antlibs&quot;.
    </p>
	<p>
		Ant is extremely flexible and does not impose coding conventions or
		directory layouts to the Java projects which adopt it as a build tool.
	</p>
	<p>
		Software development projects looking for a solution combining build tool and
		dependency management can use Ant in combination with <a href="http://ant.apache.org/ivy/">Ivy</a>.
