<h2>Native2Ascii</h2>

<h3>Description:</h3>

<p>Converts files from native encodings to ascii with escaped Unicode.
A common usage is to convert source files maintained in a native
operating system encoding, to ascii prior to compilation.</p>

<p>All matching files in the source directory are converted from a
native encoding to ascii.  If no encoding is specified, the default
encoding for the JVM is used.  If ext is specified, then output
files are renamed to use it as a new extension.  If dest and
src point to the same directory, ext is required.</p>

<p>This is a directory based task, and supports includes, includesfile,
excludes, excludesfile, and defaultexcludes along with its specific
attributes.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
&lt;native2ascii encoding=&quot;EUCJIS&quot; src=&quot;srcdir&quot; dest=&quot;srcdir&quot;
   includes=&quot;**/*.eucjis&quot; ext=&quot;.java&quot; /&gt;
</pre>

<p>Converts all files in the directory srcdir ending in eucjis
from the EUCJIS encoding to ascii and renames the to end in
.java.</p>

<pre>

   includes=&quot;**/*.java /&gt;
