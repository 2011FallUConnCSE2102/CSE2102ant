<h2>Local</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Adds a local property to the current scope. Property scopes exist at Ant's
various "block" levels. These include targets as well as the
<a href="parallel.html">Parallel</a> and <a href="sequential.html">Sequential</a>
task containers (including <a href="macrodef.html">Macrodef</a> bodies). A local
property at a given scope "shadows" properties of the same name at higher scopes,
including the global scope (declaring a local property at the global level, i.e.
outside of any scope block, has no effect). <b>Since Ant 1.8</b></p>
