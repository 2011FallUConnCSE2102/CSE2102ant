<h1>Installing Ant</h1>
<h2><a name="getting">Getting Ant</a></h2>
<h3>Binary Edition</h3>
<p>The latest stable version of Ant is available from the Ant web page <a
href="http://ant.apache.org/">http://ant.apache.org/</a>.

If you like living on the edge, you can download the latest version from <a
href="http://cvs.apache.org/builds/ant/nightly/">http://cvs.apache.org/builds/ant/nightly/</a>.</p>
<h3>Source Edition</h3>

<p>If you prefer the source edition, you can download the source for the latest Ant release from <a href="http://ant.apache.org/srcdownload.cgi">http://ant.apache.org/srcdownload.cgi</a>.

Again, if you prefer the edge, you can access
the code as it is being developed via CVS. The Jakarta website has details on
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/cvsindex.html" target="_top">accessing CVS</a>. Please checkout the
ant module.

See the section <a href="#buildingant">Building Ant</a> on how to
build Ant from the source code.
You can also access the
<a href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/ant/" target="_top">
Ant CVS repository</a> on-line. </p>

<h2><a name="sysrequirements">System Requirements</a></h2>
Ant has been used successfully on many platforms, including Linux,
commercial flavours of Unix such as Solaris and HP-UX,
Windows 9x and NT, OS/2 Warp, Novell Netware 6, OpenVMS and MacOS X.
The platforms used most for development are, in no particular order,
Linux, MacOS X, Windows XP and Unix; these are therefore that platforms
that work best.
<p>
To build and use Ant, you must have a JAXP-compliant XML parser installed and
available on your classpath.</p>
<p>
The binary distribution of Ant includes the latest version of the
<a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/index.html">Apache Xerces2</a> XML parser.
Please see
<a href="http://java.sun.com/xml/" target="_top">http://java.sun.com/xml/</a>
for more information about JAXP.
If you wish to use a different JAXP-compliant parser, you should remove
<code>xercesImpl.jar</code> and <code>xml-apis.jar</code>
from Ant's <code>lib</code> directory.

You can then either put the jars from your preferred parser into Ant's
<code>lib</code> directory or put the jars on the system classpath. 
Some parts of Ant will fail if you use an old parser, especially one
that is not namespace-aware. In particular, avoid the Crimson parser.</p>

<p>Tip: "ant -diagnostics" will list the XML parser used and its location.</p>

<p>
For the current version of Ant, you will also need a JDK installed on
your system, version 1.2 or later.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Note #2: </strong>If a JDK is not present, only the JRE runtime, then many tasks will not work.
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="installing">Installing Ant</a></h2>
<p>The binary distribution of Ant consists of the following directory layout:
<pre>
  ant
   +--- README, LICENSE, fetch.xml, other text files. //basic information
   +--- bin  // contains launcher scripts
   |
   +--- lib  // contains Ant jars plus necessary dependencies
   |
   +--- docs // contains documentation
   |      +--- ant2    // a brief description of ant2 requirements
   |      |
   |      +--- images  // various logos for html documentation
   |      |
   |      +--- manual  // Ant documentation (a must read ;-)
   |
   +--- etc // contains xsl goodies to:
            //   - create an enhanced report from xml output of various tasks.
            //   - migrate your build files and get rid of 'deprecated' warning
            //   - ... and more ;-)
</pre>

Only the <code>bin</code> and <code>lib</code> directories are
required to run Ant.

To install Ant, choose a directory and copy the distribution
file there. This directory will be known as ANT_HOME.
</p>

<table width="80%">
<tr>
  <td colspan="2">
    <b>Windows 95, Windows 98 &amp; Windows ME Note:</b>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td width="5%">&nbsp;</td>
  <td><i>
On these systems, the script used to launch Ant will have
problems if ANT_HOME is a long filename (i.e. a filename which is not
of the format known as &quot;8.3&quot;). This is due to
limitations in the OS's handling of the <code>&quot;for&quot;</code>
batch-file statement. It is recommended, therefore, that Ant be
installed in a <b>short</b>, 8.3 path, such as C:\Ant. </i>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td width="5%">&nbsp;</td>
  <td>
    <p>On these systems you will also need to configure more environment
       space to cater for the environment variables used in the Ant lauch script.
       To do this, you will need to add or update the following line in
       the <code>config.sys</code> file
    </p>
    <p><code>shell=c:\command.com c:\ /p /e:32768</code></p>
  </td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>
Before you can run Ant there is some additional set up you
will need to do unless you are installing the <a href="#jpackage">RPM 
version from jpackage.org</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add the <code>bin</code> directory to your path.</li>
<li>Set the <code>ANT_HOME</code> environment variable to the
directory where you installed Ant.  On some operating systems the ant
wrapper scripts can guess <code>ANT_HOME</code> (Unix dialects and
Windows NT/2000), but it is better to not rely on this behavior.</li>
<li>Optionally, set the <code>JAVA_HOME</code> environment variable
(see the <a href="#advanced">Advanced</a> section below).
This should be set to the directory where your JDK is installed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Do not install Ant's ant.jar file into the lib/ext
directory of the JDK/JRE. Ant is an application, whilst the extension
directory is intended for JDK extensions. In particular there are security
restrictions on the classes which may be loaded by an extension.</p>

<h3><a name="optionalTasks">Optional Tasks</a></h3>
<p>Ant supports a number of optional tasks. An optional task is a task which
typically requires an external library to function. The optional tasks are
packaged together with the core Ant tasks.</p>

<p>The external libraries required by each of the optional tasks is detailed
in the <a href="#librarydependencies">Library Dependencies</a> section. These external
libraries may either be placed in Ant's lib directory, where they will be picked up
automatically.
</p>

<h3><a name="classpath">The CLASSPATH environment variable</a></h3>
<p>

The CLASSPATH environment variable is a source of many Ant support queries. As
the round trip time for diagnosis on the Ant user mailing list can be slow, and
because filing bug reports complaining about 'ant.bat' not working will be
rejected by the developers as WORKSFORME "this is a configuration problem, not a
bug", you can save yourself a lot of time and frustration by following some
simple steps.

</p>
<ol>

<li>Do not ever set CLASSPATH. Ant does not need it, it only causes confusion
and breaks things.

</li>

<li>If you ignore the previous rule, do not ever, ever, put quotes in the
CLASSPATH, even if there is a space in a directory. This will break Ant, and it
is not needed. </li>

<li>If you ignore the first rule, do not ever, ever, have a trailing backslash
in a CLASSPATH, as it breaks Ant's ability to quote the string. Again, this is
not needed for the correct operation of the CLASSPATH environment variable, even
if a DOS directory is to be added to the path. </li>

<li>You can stop Ant using the CLASSPATH environment variable by setting the
<code>-noclasspath</code> option on the command line.</li>

</ol>

<p>

The usual symptom of CLASSPATH problems is that ant will not run with some error
about not being able to find org.apache.tools.Ant.main, or, if you have got the
quotes/backslashes wrong, some very weird Java startup error. To see if this is
the case, run <code>ant -noclasspath</code> or unset the CLASSPATH environment
variable.

</p>


<h3><a name="proxy">Proxy Configuration</a></h3>

<p> Many Ant built-in and third-party tasks use network connections to retrieve
files from HTTP servers. If you are behind a firewall with a proxy server, then
Ant needs to be configured with the proxy. Here are the different ways to do
this. </p>

<ul>

<li><b>With Java1.5</b><br>. 

When you run Ant on Java1.5, it tries to use the automatic proxy setup
mechanism. If this works -and it is a big if, as we see little evidence of it
doing so on Linux or WinXP, then your proxy is set up without you doing
anything. You can disable this feature with the <code>-noproxy</code> option.

</li>

<li><b>With explicit JVM properties.</b><br>.

These are documented <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/net/properties.html">by Sun</a>,
and control the proxy behaviour of the entire JVM. To set them in Ant, declare
them in the <code>ANT_OPTS</code> environment variable. This is the best option
for a non-mobile system. For a laptop, you have to change these settings as you
roam.

</li>

<li><b>In the build file itself</b><br>

If you are writing an build file that is always to be used behind the firewall,
the &lt;setproxy&gt; task lets you configure the proxy (which it does by setting
the JVM properties). If you do this, we strongly recommend using ant properties
to define the proxy host, port, etc, so that individuals can override the
defaults.</li>

</ul>

<p> The Ant team acknowledges that this is unsatisfactory. Until the JVM
automatic proxy setup works properly everywhere, explicit JVM options via
ANT_ARGS are probably the best solution. Note that setting properties on Ant's
command line do not work, because those are <i>Ant properties</i> being set, not
JVM options. This means the following does not set up the command line:

</p>

<pre>ant -Dhttp.proxyHost=proxy -Dhttp.proxyPort=81</pre>

<p> All it does is set up two Ant properties.</p> <p>One other troublespot with
proxies is with authenticating proxies. Ant cannot go beyond what the JVM does
here, and as it is very hard to remotely diagnose, test and fix proxy-related
problems, users who work behind a secure proxy will have to spend much time
configuring the JVM properties until they are happy. </p>


<h3><a name="windows">Windows and OS/2</a></h3>
<p>Assume Ant is installed in <code>c:\ant\</code>. The following sets up the
environment:</p>
<pre>set ANT_HOME=c:\ant
set JAVA_HOME=c:\jdk-1.5.0.05
set PATH=%PATH%;%ANT_HOME%\bin</pre>

<h3>Linux/Unix (bash)</h3>
<p>Assume Ant is installed in <code>/usr/local/ant</code>. The following sets up
the environment:</p>
<pre>export ANT_HOME=/usr/local/ant
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/jdk-1.5.0.05
export PATH=${PATH}:${ANT_HOME}/bin</pre>

<h3>Linux/Unix (csh)</h3>
<pre>setenv ANT_HOME /usr/local/ant
setenv JAVA_HOME /usr/local/jdk/jdk-1.5.0.05
set path=( $path $ANT_HOME/bin )</pre>

<p>
Having a symbolic link set up to point to the JVM/JSK version makes updates more seamless. </p>
<a name="jpackage"></a>
<h3>RPM version from jpackage.org</h3>
<p>
The <a href="www.jpackage.org">JPackage project</a> distributes an RPM version of Ant.  
With this version, it is not necessary to set <code> JAVA_HOME </code>or 
<code> ANT_HOME </code>environment variables and the RPM installer will correctly
place the Ant executable on your path.  The <code> ANT_HOME </code>environment variable will
be ignored, if set, when running the JPackage version of Ant.
</p><p>
Optional jars for the JPackage version are handled in two ways.  The easiest, and
best way is to get these external libraries from JPackage if JPackage has them 
available.  (Note: for each such library, you will have to get both the external 
package itself (e.g. <code>oro-2.0.8-2jpp.noarch.rpm</code>) and the small library that links 
ant and the external package (e.g. <code>ant-apache-oro-1.6.2-3jpp.noarch.rpm</code>).
</p><p>
However, JPackage does not package proprietary software, and since some of the
optional packages depend on proprietary jars, they must be handled as follows.  
This may violate the spirit of JPackage, but it is necessary if you need these proprietary packages.
For example, suppose you want to install support for starteam, which jpackage does not 
support:
<ol>
<li>Decide where you want to deploy the extra jars.  One option is in <code>$ANT_HOME/lib</code>, 
which, for JPackage is usually <code>/usr/share/ant/lib</code>.  Another, less messy option
is to create an <code>.ant/lib</code> subdirectory of your home directory and place your 
non-jpackage ant jars there, thereby avoiding mixing jpackage
libraries with non-jpacakge stuff in the same folder.  More information on where Ant finds its libraries is available 
<a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/running.html#libs">here</a></li>
<li>Download a non-jpackage binary distribution from the regular <a href="http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi">Apache Ant site</a></li>
<li>Unzip or untar the distribution into a temporary directory</li>
<li>Copy the linking jar, in this case <code>ant-starteam.jar</code>, into the library directory you 
chose in step 1 above.</li>
<li>Copy the proprietary jar itself into the same directory.</li>
</ol>
Finally, if for some reason you are running on a system with both the JPackage and Apache versions of Ant
available, if you should want to run the Apache version (which will have to be specified with an absolute file name,
not found on the path), you should use Ant's <code>--noconfig</code> command-line switch to avoid JPackage's classpath mechanism.


<h3><a name="advanced">Advanced</a></h3>

<p>There are lots of variants that can be used to run Ant. What you need is at
least the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The classpath for Ant must contain <code>ant.jar</code> and any jars/classes
needed for your chosen JAXP-compliant XML parser.</li>
<li>When you need JDK functionality
(such as for the <a href="CoreTasks/javac.html">javac</a> task or the
<a href="CoreTasks/rmic.html">rmic</a> task), then <code>tools.jar</code>
must be added. The scripts supplied with Ant,
in the <code>bin</code> directory, will add
the required JDK classes automatically, if the <code>JAVA_HOME</code>
environment variable is set.</li>

<li>When you are executing platform-specific applications, such as the
<a href="CoreTasks/exec.html">exec</a> task or the
<a href="CoreTasks/cvs.html">cvs</a> task, the property <code>ant.home</code>
must be set to the directory containing where you installed Ant. Again
this is set by the Ant scripts to the value of the ANT_HOME environment
variable.</li>
</ul>
The supplied ant shell scripts all support an <tt>ANT_OPTS</tt>
environment variable which can be used to supply extra options
to ant. Some of the scripts also read in an extra script stored
in the users home directory, which can be used to set such options. Look
at the source for your platform's invocation script for details.

<hr>
<h2><a name="buildingant">Building Ant</a></h2>
<p>To build Ant from source, you can either install the Ant source distribution
or checkout the ant module from CVS.</p>
<p>Once you have installed the source, change into the installation
directory.</p>

<p>Set the <code>JAVA_HOME</code> environment variable
to the directory where the JDK is installed.
See <a href="#installing">Installing Ant</a>
for examples on how to do this for your operating system. </p>

<p><b>Note</b>: The bootstrap process of Ant requires a greedy
compiler like Sun's javac or jikes.  It does not work with gcj or
kjc.</b>

<p>Make sure you have downloaded any auxiliary jars required to
build tasks you are interested in. These should either be available
on the CLASSPATH or added to the <code>lib/optional</code>
directory of the source tree.
See <a href="#librarydependencies">Library Dependencies</a>
for a list of jar requirements for various features.
Note that this will make the auxiliary jars
available for the building of Ant only. For running Ant you will
still need to
make the jars available as described under
<a href="#installing">Installing Ant</a>.</p>

<p>Your are now ready to build Ant:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>build -Ddist.dir=&lt;<i>directory_to_contain_Ant_distribution</i>&gt; dist</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Windows</i>)</p>
  <p><code>build.sh -Ddist.dir=&lt;<i>directory_to_contain_Ant_distribution</i>&gt; dist</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Unix</i>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This will create a binary distribution of Ant in the directory you specified.</p>

<p>The above action does the following:</p>
<ul>

<li>If necessary it will bootstrap the Ant code. Bootstrapping involves the manual
compilation of enough Ant code to be able to run Ant. The bootstrapped Ant is
used for the remainder of the build steps. </li>

<li>Invokes the bootstrapped Ant with the parameters passed to the build script. In
this case, these parameters define an Ant property value and specify the &quot;dist&quot; target
in Ant's own <code>build.xml</code> file.</li>
</ul>

<p>On most occasions you will not need to explicitly bootstrap Ant since the build
scripts do that for you. If however, the build file you are using makes use of features
not yet compiled into the bootstrapped Ant, you will need to manually bootstrap.
Run <code>bootstrap.bat</code> (Windows) or <code>bootstrap.sh</code> (UNIX)
to build a new bootstrap version of Ant.</p>

If you wish to install the build into the current <code>ANT_HOME</code>
directory, you can use:
<blockquote>
  <p><code>build install</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Windows</i>)</p>
  <p><code>build.sh install</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Unix</i>)</p>
</blockquote>

You can avoid the lengthy Javadoc step, if desired, with:
<blockquote>
  <p><code>build install-lite</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Windows</i>)</p>
  <p><code>build.sh install-lite</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Unix</i>)</p>
</blockquote>
This will only install the <code>bin</code> and <code>lib</code> directories.
<p>Both the <code>install</code> and
<code>install-lite</code> targets will overwrite
the current Ant version in <code>ANT_HOME</code>.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="librarydependencies">Library Dependencies</a></h2>
<p>The following libraries are needed in Ant's classpath 
if you are using the
indicated feature. Note that only one of the regexp libraries is
needed for use with the mappers
(and Java 1.4 and higher includes a regexp implementation which
Ant will find automatically).
You will also need to install the
Ant optional jar containing the task definitions to make these
tasks available. Please refer to the <a href="#optionalTasks">
Installing Ant / Optional Tasks</a> section above.</p>

<h3><a name="diagnostics">Diagnostics</a></h3>

<p> Ant has a built in diagnostics feature. If you run <code>ant
-diagnostics</code> ant will look at its internal state and print it out. This
code will check and print the following things. </p>

<ul>

<li>The version of ant.jar and ant-optional.jar -and that they match</li>

<li>Which JAR files are int ANT_HOME/lib

<li>Which optional tasks are available. If a task is not listed as being
available, either it is not present, or libraries that it depends on are
absent.</li>


<li>XML Parser information</li>

<li>JVM system properties
</li>

<li>The status of the temp directory. If this is not writeable, or its clock is
horribly wrong (possible if it is on a network drive), a lot of tasks will fail
with obscure error messages.</li>

<li>The current time zone as Java sees it. If this is not what it should be for
your location, then dependency logic may get confused.

</ul>

<p>
Running <code>ant -diagnostics</code> is a good way to check that ant is installed. It is also a first step towards self-diagnosis of any problem. Any configuration problem reported to the user mailing list will probably result ins someone asking you to run the command and show the results, so save time by using it yourself.
</p>

<p>
For under-IDE diagostics, use the &lt;diagnostics&gt; task to run the same tests as an ant task. This can be added to a diagnostics target in a build file to see what tasks are available under the IDE, what the XML parser and classpath is, etc. 
</p>

<h3><a name="ant-user">user mailing list</a></h3>

<p> If you cannot get Ant installed or working, the Ant user mailing list is the
best place to start with any problem. Please do your homework first, make sure
that it is not a <a href="classpath">CLASSPATH</a> problem, and run a <a
href="diagnostics">diagnostics check</a> to see what Ant thinks of its own
state. Why the user list, and not the developer list? Because there are more users than developers, so more people who can help you. </p>

<p>

Please only file a bug report against Ant for a configuration/startup problem if
there really is a fixable bug in Ant related to configuration, such as it not
working on a particular platform, with a certain JVM version, etc, or if you are
advised to do it by the user mailing list.
