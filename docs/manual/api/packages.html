<p>If you see this page online at <a
href="http://ant.apache.org">ant.apache.org</a>, it is not a bug, but
on purpose.  We do not provide an online version of the API docs, they
are included with all our distributions, including the nightly
builds.</p>

<!--p>If you want to see the API docs for the latest code, they are
generated by <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/gump/">Apache Gump</a>
and linked from <a
href="http://nagoya.apache.org/gump/javadoc/ant/build/javadocs/index.html">http://nagoya.apache.org/gump/javadoc/ant/build/javadocs/index.html</a>.</p-->
