<b>Apache Ant API has not been generated</b>

<p>If you see this page online at <a
href="http://ant.apache.org/">ant.apache.org</a>, it is not a bug, but
on purpose.  We do not provide an online version of the API docs, they
are included with all our distributions, including the nightly
builds.</p>
