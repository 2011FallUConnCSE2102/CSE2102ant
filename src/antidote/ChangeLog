	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/ProjectProxy.java: Started rework of
	project data model, using elements from the XML parser directly
	through the new Ant Construction Set package.

2000-11-08  Simeon H.K. Fitch  <simeon@fitch.net>

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/About.java: Useless tweaking inspired
	by procrastination.

2000-11-05  Simeon H.K. Fitch  <simeon@fitch.net>

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/LogLevelEnum.java: Added log level
	enumeration for use with combo boxes (drops nicely into default model).

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/event/BuildEventType.java: Added
	delivering of event to a BuildListener based on enumeration value.

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/ProjectProxy.java: Added generation of
	BuildEvent on project start and finish, as the project itself
	doesn't generate theses events (unfortunately).

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/Console.java: Added filtering level,
	and clearing of buffer when a new build starts.

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/AntEditor.java: Added automatic border
	for all subclasses.

2000-11-04  Simeon H.K. Fitch  <simeon@fitch.net>

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/ProjectProxy.java: Added inner class to
	execute the build in a separate thread.

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/event/EventBus.java: Added check to see
	if postEvent() is being called on the AWTEvent thread, and if not,
	post the dispatching of the event to that thread. This is needed
	as most of the listeners will be bound to GUI components and will
	be updating their state (which must occur on the event thread).

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/ProjectProxy.java: Added a
	BuildListener to forward events to the EventBus.

2000-11-03  Simeon H.K. Fitch  <simeon@fitch.net>

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/Antidote.java: Removed hard-coded
	Console class.

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/Console.java: Changed to a real
	AntEditor class, initialized by the config file.

2000-11-02  Simeon H.K. Fitch  <simeon@fitch.net>

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/event/EventBus.java: Added interrupt
	level support.

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/About.java: Created
	
2000-11-01  Simeon H.K. Fitch  <simeon@fitch.net>

	* org/apache/tools/ant/gui/Main.java: Added XMLHelper.init() call
	
	* build.xml: Updated run target to include ant.jar in classpath.
