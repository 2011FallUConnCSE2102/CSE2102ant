TODO List:
    * Add a Progress Monitor for file loading (especially for slow boxen like
      mine) .

    * Implement some for of refid hyperlinking functionality.

    * Provide some sort of class path debugging support.

    * Eat own dog food more.

    * Dispatch tree node change events when the properties editor changes a 
      node value. This will make sure that the node gets displayed correctly in
      the project navigator.

    * Implement a custom tree node renderer with better icons.

    * Implement a build progress reporter.

    * Add "syntax" colorization to the console window, with a preferences
      editor for setting up the styles.

    * Rework EventResponder to remove hard coded command translation.

    * Figure out an approach to gracefully stopping a running build.

    * Add error handler for SAX parser to better report loading errors.

    * Create an error dialog that is able to display a stack backtrace if
      desired.

    * Add support to ActionManager to handle toggle actions in tool bar. Also
      need a better way of detecting the selected state of the action button.

    * Project properties viewer, including the ability to view
      dependencies (local and cascading).

    * Acquire or implement a logging facility.

(pending Ant 2.0)
    
    * Need Ant API access to:
        - Tasks within a Target
        - The topo sorted task list to get flattened dependencies
        - The build setup code to recduce code replication.
        - Normalize the Ant data model to represent a more consistent
          tree structure, and more bean-like API.

    * Better define the data model architecture, and how it interfaces
      with the Ant data model.
