TODO List:
    * Need Ant API access to:
        - Tasks within a Target
        - The topo sorted task list to get flattened dependencies
        - The build setup code to recduce code replication.
        - Normalize the Ant data model to represent a more consistent
          tree structure, and more bean-like API.

    * Better define the data model architecture, and how it interfaces
      with the Ant data model.

    * Project properties viewer, including the ability to view
      dependencies (local and cascading).

    * Acquire or implement a logging facility.

    * Build launching capability.
